    "This is the self-contained installation guide to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install an IDE that is capable of compiling executing Python code. The IDE here is Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "2. Install Tensorflow and other required packages such as Keras to develop and execute machine learning and deep learning. The version of Tensorflow is the one compatible with Python 3.7. For the latest version of Tensorflow, please refer the Installation Guide (Python 3.8) instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "The installation guide for the first and second topics is heavily inspired by the one created by Dr Heaton, who is currently an adjunct instructor for the Sever Institute at Washington University. The link to the original guide from Dr Jeff Heaton is as follows: [Installation Guide](https://github.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/blob/master/install/tensorflow-install-jul-2020.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install the IDE\n",
    "1. As mentioned earlier, the first is to install the latest version of Python and its IDE. There are two mainstream Python distributions: one is Miniconda, which is a minimal installer that only includes conda, Python, and other essential packages. The other is Anaconda, which is an 'ultimate' installer that includes over 1,500 other packages. As quoted by the original document [Anaconda vs Miniconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/download.html#anaconda-or-miniconda):\n",
    "\n",
    "|Anaconda | Miniconda |\n",
    "| :------------ | :-------------- |\n",
    "| Choose Anaconda if we:  | Choose Miniconda if we:  |\n",
    "| 1. Are new to conda or Python. | 1. Do not mind installing each of the packages we want to use individually.| \n",
    "| 2. Like the convenience of having Python and over 1,500 scientific packages automatically installed at once. | 2. Do not have time or disk space to install over 1,500 packages at once. | \n",
    "| 3. Have the time and disk space --- a few minutes and 3 GB. | 3. Want fast access to Python and the conda commands and we wish to sort out the other programs later. |\n",
    "| 4. Do not want to individually install each of the packages we want to use. | | \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Like many other data scientists and instructors, I strongly recommended using the Miniconda because we can install the most frequently used packages on wer own while discarding the rest if we use Miniconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The link to download **Miniconda** is as follows: [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "* The link to download **Anaconda** is as follows: [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. After the download is finished, open the installer and follow the instructions to install Miniconda. Then, open the Miniconda command prompt with administrator privileges and install Jupyter Notebook using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install -y jupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. The following steps to install Tensorflow and other necessary dependencies are both applicable for **Anaconda** and **Miniconda**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Tensorflow\n",
    "1. After the Jupyter Notebook is installed, we will install Tensorflow for deep learning. To do so, we firstly create an Anaconda environment. Here, I created an environment called **tensorflow** to hold the Python v3.7 instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create --name tensorflow python=3.7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Note: it is important to check which version of Python is compatible with the newest version of Tensorflow. As of May 2021, Python v3.7 is compatible with Tensorflow v2.2.4 that is GPU-supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To enter this environment, use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda activate tensorflow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: whenever we start working on wer Tensorflow project in Windows, **remember to activate the Anaconda command prompt environment**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Next, add Jupyter support to the new environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install nb_conda\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. With all the important pieces are in place, we then install Tensorflow. Here, we will install the version that supports CPU and GPU. If we want to use GPU for Tensorflow, check to see whether we have a compatible NVIDIA GPU: [GPU](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus). Use the following command to install the GPU-supported Tensorflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install -c anaconda tensorflow-gpu\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: use the following command to install the normal Tensorflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install -c anaconda tensorflow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Finally, we register the environment using the following command (here, we type `tensorflow` as our `environment_name`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python -m ipykernel install --user --name <environment_name> --display-name \"Python 3.7 (tensorflow)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python -m ipykernel install --user --name tensorflow --display-name \"Python 3.7 (tensorflow)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: we need to make sure wer **tensorflow** environment is activated before using this command. Besides, in Linux or Unix-based OS, the registration of environment is optional, However, in Windows OS, we must run this in order not to encountered dead-kernel error.\n",
    "   \n",
    "(Optional), we can use the following command to resolve any dependency failure/conflict or to update dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda update --all\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install additional libraries:\n",
    "1. Use the following command to install the required libraries/packages that are included in the file `tools.yml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda env update --file tools.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Note: As of June 2020, the latest version of Keras is v2.4.0, and it is only compatible to Python v3.8 or lower. Thus, please make sure we have a compatible version of Python before installing Keras. Additionally, please make sure wer **tensorflow** environment is activated before using this command.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We can find all installed libraries/packages in our environment by using the following command (this command only executes correctly if we already activated the environment):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda list\n",
    "```\n",
    "   \n",
    "(Optional), similar to the previous steps, we can resolve any conflict between libraries/packages by updating the environment with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda update --all\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Note**: After we run this command to resolve the conflicts, there will be conflict between the packages associated with Tensorflow including _tensorboard_, _tensorflow-estimator_, etc. To resolve this conflict, we synchronize them to the 2.1.0 version using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install <package_name>==2.1.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Test the environment:\n",
    "1. We can now start the Jupyter notebook by using the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We can also run the following code to check that whether we have the versions expected."

    "## Run the benchmark on an offline computer\n",
    "In an offline computer, we cannot access [Anaconda server](https://repo.anaconda.com/) or other servers. Therefore, we have to load the packed version of the **tensorflow** environment in the offline computer to run the benchmark program. The **Conda-pack** dependency is a great way to do this. Below is the instruction to pack the **tensorflow** environment in the source machine (online), then unpack and execute in the target machine\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### In the source machine, where we installed the **tensorflow** environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the `(base)` environment, install the `conda-pack` library to get the function of environment packing by using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install conda-pack\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Activate the **tensorflow** environment then pack it to a file named `tensorflow.tar.gz` using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda activate tensorflow\n",
    "conda pack -n tensorflow -o tensorflow.tar.gz\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If we run into the error of inconsistent environment, use the command `conda update --all` to resolve any conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the packing is successful, copy the generated `tensorflow.tar.gz` file to the target machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In the target machine, where we want to run the benchmark:\n",
    "1. Install the IDE in the target machine using the above instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Open the **Windows Command Prompt**, create a `tensorflow` directory to unpack the environment, then extract the latter using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "mkdir tensorflow\n",
    "tar -xzf tensorflow.tar.gz -C tensorflow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: if the `tar` function is not working, we can use 7zip software to extract the `tensorflow.tar.gz` file into the `tensorflow` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Change the current directory to that containing wer unpacked environment, then activate it using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd unpacked-environment\n",
    ".\\Scripts\\activate.bat\n",
    ".\\Scripts\\conda-unpack.exe\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. After the activation, the **Command Prompt** should tell we that we are in the right environment. At this point, the environment is exactly as if we installed it here using conda directly. All scripts should work fine. we can verify by running Python within this environment.\n",
    "```\n",
    "(tensorflow) C:\\Some\\Path\\Where\\wer\\Environment\\Is> python\n",
