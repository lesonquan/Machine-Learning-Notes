    "# Install the IDE\n",
    "1. As mentioned earlier, the first is to install the latest version of Python and its IDE. There are two mainstream Python distributions: one is Miniconda, which is a minimal installer that only includes conda, Python, and other essential packages. The other is Anaconda, which is an 'ultimate' installer that includes over 1,500 other packages. As quoted by the original document [Anaconda vs Miniconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/download.html#anaconda-or-miniconda):\n",
    "\n",
    "|Anaconda | Miniconda |\n",
    "| :------------ | :-------------- |\n",
    "| Choose Anaconda if you:  | Choose Miniconda if you:  |\n",
    "| 1. Are new to conda or Python. | 1. Do not mind installing each of the packages you want to use individually.| \n",
    "| 2. Like the convenience of having Python and over 1,500 scientific packages automatically installed at once. | 2. Do not have time or disk space to install over 1,500 packages at once. | \n",
    "| 3. Have the time and disk space --- a few minutes and 3 GB. | 3. Want fast access to Python and the conda commands and you wish to sort out the other programs later. |\n",
    "| 4. Do not want to individually install each of the packages you want to use. | | \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Like many other data scientists and instructors, I strongly recommended using the Miniconda because you can install the most frequently used packages on your own while discarding the rest if you use Miniconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The link to download **Miniconda** is as follows: [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "* The link to download **Anaconda** is as follows: [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. After the download is finished, open the installer and follow the instructions to install Miniconda. Then, open the Miniconda command prompt with administrator privileges and install Jupyter Notebook using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install -y jupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. The following steps to install Tensorflow and other necessary dependencies are both applicable for **Anaconda** and **Miniconda**.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Install Tensorflow\n",
    "1. First, we must install the required sets of software from NVIDIA®:\n",
    "* [NVIDIA® GPU drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx?lang=en-us), select from their drop-down list to identify the appropriate driver for our NVIDIA GPU. On the other hand, it is important to check whether our GPU is supported by checking the information about compatibility from NVIDIA: [GPU](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus)\n",
    "* [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive), select the latest version of CUDA Toolki to download. Besides, strongly recommended selecting `exe (local)` as the installation option. As of 12.6.2021, the latest version is v11.3.0.\n",
    "* [CUPTI](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cupti/), this ships together with CUDA Toolkit.\n",
    "* [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download), select the latest version of cuDN, then select the option for cuDNN for Windows (x86). After the file is downloaded, unzip it to the recommended path (if the folder is not available, we just need to create it):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "C:\\tools\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next, we need to add the paths to make CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN works. To do so, from the Windows Taskbar, we  search for `Edit the system environment variables` from `Start`, the select the former to open the dialog. In the `System variables`, we select `Path` and then select `Edit` to open another dialog.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When the dialog opens, we select `New` to add the following paths:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v11.3\\bin\n",
    "C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v11.3\\extras\\CUPTI\\lib64\n",
    "C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v11.3\\include\n",
    "C:\\tools\\cuda\\bin\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then, we select all the `OK` to apply the changes and close the dialogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. After all the software are successfully installed, we open `Anaconda Prompt` and create an environment with Python 3.8 using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create --name tensorflow-latest python=3.8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. We enter the newly created environment by activating, then install the GPU-supported Tensorflow using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda activate tensorflow-latest\n",
    "pip install tensorflow-gpu\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: whenever we start working on your Tensorflow project in Windows, **remember to activate the Anaconda command prompt environment**.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. To verify whether our installation of Tensorflow is successful, we can go to Python inside our `Anaconda Prompt` and import Tensorflow using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python\n",
    "import tensorflow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. If the installation is successful, the following line will be printed:\n",
    "```\n",
    "I tensorflow/stream_executor/platform/default/dso_loader.cc:53] Successfully opened dynamic library cudart64_110.dll\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Install other required packages\n",
    "1. With the environment is still active, we first add add Jupyter support to the new environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install nb_conda\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next, we register the environment using the following command (here, we type `tensorflow-latest` as our `environment_name`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python -m ipykernel install --user --name <environment_name> --display-name \"Python 3.8 (tensorflow)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We then use the following command to install the required libraries/packages that are included in the file `tools.yml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda env update --file tools.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. We can find all installed libraries/packages in our environment by using the following command (this command only executes correctly if we already activated the environment):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda list\n",
    "```\n",
    "(Optional), similar to the previous steps, we can resolve any conflict between libraries/packages by updating the environment with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda update --all\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Note**: After we run this command to resolve the conflicts, there will be conflict between the packages associated with Tensorflow including _tensorboard_, _tensorflow-estimator_, _tensorflow_, etc. To resolve this conflict, we synchronize them all to the 2.5.0 version using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install <package_name>==2.1.0\n",
    "```"
